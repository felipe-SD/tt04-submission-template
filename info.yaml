project:
  wokwi_id:    354858054593504257        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Observar el funcionamiento de circuitos lógicos básicos; compuertas y flip-flops "      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: | 
      mediante entradas comunes se observa la diferencia en salida de las distintas compuertas lógicas AND,OR y sus variaciones

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      seleccione la compuerta o flip flop a probar mediante los pines de selección y aplique las señales correspondientes a las entradas
